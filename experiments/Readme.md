        C++ Thread Priority Management

Introduction:
==============

This repository contains the source code for a C++ program (std_thread_prority.cpp) that demonstrates how to manage thread priorities in a Linux environment using the POSIX thread library (pthread).

Functionality:

The program defines a ThreadManager class that provides two functionalities:
1. printThreadAttributes(pthread_t thread_handle, bool bf = true): Prints information about a thread's priority and scheduling policy (before or after modification, controlled by the bf flag).
1. setThreadAttributes(std::thread& trd, const int priority, const int policy): Attempts to set the priority and scheduling policy of a running thread (error handling included).
Limitations:

Successfully setting thread priorities often requires root privileges.
The program includes basic error handling to warn users about this potential limitation.
The supported scheduling policies might vary depending on the Linux system.
This program demonstrates setting priorities with SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_FIFO, and SCHED_RR.
Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Compile the program using a C++ compiler like g++ with the -lpthread flag:

Bash
g++ -o std_thread_prority std_thread_prority.cpp -lpthread
Use code with caution.
Run the program:

Bash
./std_thread_prority
Use code with caution.
This will print information about a thread's priority before and after attempting to modify it (assuming sufficient privileges).

Additional Notes:
This is a basic example of thread priority management in C++.
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSes) offer dedicated features for more robust real-time thread control.
Consider including resources or links to relevant documentation about thread management and scheduling policies in Linux.
