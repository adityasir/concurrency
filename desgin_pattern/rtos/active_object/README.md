Project Overview:
-----------------
 The Active Object Pattern is a concurrency design pattern aimed at mitigating mutual exclusion issues by encapsulating an object's behavior within its own thread of control.
 Also known as the Active Model or Active Pattern, it is based on the principles of segregation and separation of concerns, promoting modularity and maintainability in concurrent systems.

Active Objects exhibit the following characteristics:

1. Private Data: Each Active Object maintains its own private data, ensuring data isolation and preventing data races.
2. Dedicated Thread: Each Active Object has its own dedicated thread of control, responsible for executing its behavior asynchronously.
3. Dedicated Event Queue: Active Objects communicate with the outside world through a dedicated event queue.
   Clients enqueue requests or messages into the object's event queue, which are then processed sequentially by the object's thread.

Best Practices of Concurrency:
-----------------------------
1. Incorporating the Active Object Pattern into your concurrent programming practices involves adhering to the following best practices:
2. Keep Data Isolated and Private: Ensure that data associated with Active Objects is isolated, private, and bound to their respective threads.
   This prevents shared data access and eliminates the need for explicit mutual exclusion mechanisms.
3. Embrace asynchronous communication between threads using message passing.
   Active Objects communicate with each other and with external components via asynchronous messages.
   Promoting loose coupling and reducing the risk of     deadlocks and contention.
4. Structure the execution flow of Active Objects around "message pumps" or event loops.
   This allows Active Objects to process incoming messages sequentially and non-blockingly, ensuring responsiveness and scalability in concurrent systems.
